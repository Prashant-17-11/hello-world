# hello-world
My first step into the exciting world of coding.
This my test run for understanding the working of git-hub.
I am also working on mastering the ten finger typing approach simultaneously.
I aspire to become an expert coder with an solid foundation in all the coding concepts.
I have picked C++ as my begining language while I learn the concepts of data structure and algorithms.
With time I intend to learn android development and web development.
I am pretty excited to be begining my journey.
